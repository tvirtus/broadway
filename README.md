# broadway

In this project, you'll create a website, Broadway, an image of which is provided in the steps below. You are to use your knowledge of HTML & CSS to recreate the web page, with several important considerations:

1. The website will look like this (https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/freelance-one/broadway/mocks/broadway.png). You can also find a detailed description of the styles in these redline mocks (https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/freelance-one/broadway/mocks/broadway.png).

2. You are to use Git and GitHub for version control, to initialize the Git repository, commit each change, and push the changes to GitHub.

3. You are to use the Command Line Interface for each file or directory you create for the project.

4. You will find the images used in this site here:
